# Question 1

## 1

Implement the function: `int minInArray(int arr[], int arrSize)`.

This function is given arr, an array of integers, and its logical size, 
`arrSize`. When called, it returns the minimum value in `arr`.

## 2 

Write a program that reads from the user a sequence of 20 integers 
(unnecessarily different from one another) into an array, and outputs the 
minimum value, and all the indices it appears in the array.

Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the 
following example:

    Please enter 20 integers separated by a space:
    14 5 12 5 6 14 5 12 14 12 14 6 8 7 5 136 9 2189 10 6
    The minimum value is 5, and it is located in the following indices: 1 3 6 14

Note: You may want to define additional functions for your program to use.
