# Question 2

A *palindrome* is a word, which reads the same backward or forward. For 
example, noon, civic, radar, level, rotor, kayak, reviver, racecar, redder, 
madam, and refer are all palindromes.

a. Implement a function `bool isPalindrome(string str)` that, given a string 
  `str` containing a word, returns true if and only if `str` is a palindrome.
  
b. Write a program that reads a word from the user and announces to the user 
   if it is a palindrome or not.

Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the following example:

    Please enter a word: level
    level is a palindrome
