# Question 5

Write a program that reads a personâ€™s name in the following format:
first name, then middle name or initial, and then last name.

The program then outputs the name in the following format:

    Last_Name, First_Name Middle_Initial.

For example, the input `Mary Average User` should produce the output:

    User, Mary A.

The input `Mary A. User` should also produce the output `User, Mary A.`.

Note that your program should work the same and place a period after the 
middle initial even if the input did not contain a period.

_Hint:_ You may want to use three string variables rather than one large string 
variable for the input. You may find it easier *not* to use `getline`.
